Installing Service on Lion and Snow Leopard
-------------------------------------------

Starting from a **.workflow** file

1. double click on **.workflow** file
1. Lion should ask "file comes from internet..." you say continue
1. Lion should ask "install service or open in automator?" you click on install button
1. all done, now in Finder under Services menu you should see the new item

but if Lion doesn't ask to install you need to copy the file manually

1. Using Finder go to /Users/**you account name**/Library
1. inside Library folder you should see a folder called *Services*
1. if the folder *Services* doesn't exists you must create it
1. copy the file **.workflow** into Services folder
1. all done, now in Finder under Services menu you should see the new item

maybe the Library folder isn't visible from Finder (this is the default behaviour on Lion)

1. open a Finder window and press Command+Shift+G (or from Finder menu Go -> "Go to Folder...")
1. a dialog appears where you can input the destination folder
1. type ~/Library and press enter
1. inside Library folder you should see a folder called *Services*
1. if the folder *Services* doesn't exists you must create it
1. copy the file **.workflow** into Services folder
1. all done, now in Finder under Services menu you should see the new item
